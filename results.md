- The most populated states are State of Mexico, Veracruz, Mexico City, Jalisco, Guanajuato and Nuevo Leon.

- The states with the most number of disappearances are Tamaulipas, State of Mexico, Sinaloa, Jalisco, and Puebla.

- The five states with the highest rate of disappearances per 100,000 are: 

	a) Tamaulipas at 174 per 100,000
	b) Sinaloa at 102 per 100,000
	c) Colima at 102 per 100,000
	d) Sonora at 75 per 100,0000
	e) Chihuahua at 61 per 100,000

- The above indicates that northern states have the highest rates in the country. Colima, coastal state with small population, has seen a surge in crime rates in recent years

- States located in the Yucatan Peninsula (Yucatan, Campeche, Chiapas, Tabasco) have the lowest disappearance rate nationwide.

- Thus, efforts to decrease disappearances should be concentrated in northern states.
